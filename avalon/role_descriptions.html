			<h1>Good</h1>
			<dl>
				<dt>Merlin</dt>
				<dd>
				Merlin can see all evil players except Mordred and Oberon.
				He cannot see specific roles, so, for example, he doesn't know if an evil person is the assassin
				or just a lowly minion. All he knows is that they are evil.
				Mordred and Oberon are the two exceptions to Merlin's ability to see evil.
				To Merlin, Mordred and Oberon are indistinguishable from good roles.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Percival</dt>
				<dd>
				Percival can see Merlin and Morgana, but he cannot tell which is which.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Loyal</dt>
				<dd>
				This role has no knowledge of the roles of other players.
				</dd>
			</dl>
				
			<h1>Evil</h1>
			<dl>
				<dt>Morgana</dt>
				<dd>
				Morgana is a normal evil role except that Percival cannot distinguish her from Merlin.
				She can see that all other evil players (except Oberon) are evil.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Mordred</dt>
				<dd>
				Mordred is a normal evil role except that Merlin cannot tell that he is evil.
				He can see that all other evil players (except Oberon) are evil.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Oberon</dt>
				<dd>
				Oberon is evil, but he has no information about the other players, and they have no information about him.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Assassin</dt>
				<dd>
				The assassin is a normal evil role until the end of the game.
				At the end of the game, the assassin gets one guess at who Merlin is.
				If he is correct in his guess, he assassinates Merlin and the evil team wins the game,
				regardless of the number of missions failed during the game.
				If he is incorrect in his guess, the winning team is decided by the number of missions failed during the game.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Minion</dt>
				<dd>
				This role has no knowledge of the roles of other players.
				</dd>
